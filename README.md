July 26: Started the project 
I finally got my account verfied
and after some reaserch i realised that i need several componets 
Keyboard switches
Sk6812 MINI-E for the keybaord lighting and maybe some ligthing stirps for the underglow
PCB
the microcontroler the one sending infomation to the computer
Diodes to have a Nkeyrollover keyboard
case
Plate for the keycapps
stabilisiseds this is needed for the bigger keys like the space bar
and the firmware needs to be coded up! 
my Personal challange is to do this in a day!.
