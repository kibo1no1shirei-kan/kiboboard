```July 26: Started the project 
I finally got my account verfied
and after some reaserch i realised that i need several componets 
Keyboard switches
Sk6812 MINI-E for the keybaord lighting and maybe some ligthing stirps for the underglow
PCB
the microcontroler the one sending infomation to the computer
Diodes to have a Nkeyrollover keyboard
case
Plate for the keycapps
stabilisiseds this is needed for the bigger keys like the space bar
and the firmware needs to be coded up! 
my Personal challange is to do this in a day!.


Current Parts list 
Cherry MX2A Red
SK6812 MINI-E
PCB - to be designed 
```
Same day calculated the amount of GPIO NEEDED for a iso 105 keyboard its 27 
![alt text](keyboard-layout-1.png)

6 hours

-------
27/7/2025
decided that that was the wrong layout
![alt text](image.png)
but instead without any home or the function cluster

---------
needed GPIO
27 GPIO for keys 
1 GPIO Per key RBG 
1 UNDERGLOW
9 rotary encoders(3)(this repaced the function key clusters)
TFT SCRENN  1 3(cs,dc,reset)+ shared SPI TFT SCREEN 2 3 (CS,DC,RESET) 
usb/misc1-2 

= **54 total GPIOs**
---------
MOB 
STM32F407VET6 (CONTROLLER)
SK6812 MINI-E (LIGHTS)
Cable Labs Artisanal Aviator Cable â€“ Cyber Purple
Cherry MX2A Red Switches
ILI9341 320x240 TFT
0.91 Oled I2C Iic Module Lcd Display Screen Ssd1306 Chip
3 knobs with press

journal entry for 27-29
-------
my journal got dealyed due to multiple brownouts i am at a cafe 
[will add picture later]

for 27 i spent 5 hours looking for a microcontroler 

for 29 i spend no at 2:13pm wrtting i spend 2 hours looking for a micorcontroler 
i realised that the already pikced microcontroller is suitable for 5.V
and settles on using USB3300

mob update
add 
USB3300 FOR RAZER SPEEDS
and a USB C connector

 welll uhh turns out i need months i realise will contnue the project reading and expermeting but i decided to put all my other efforts on summer of making instead

 total hours spend 15

 just read it might be august and hackpad i decided to read the hackpad and use that information instead
